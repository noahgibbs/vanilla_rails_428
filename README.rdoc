This is a vanilla Ruby 4.2.8 application, created using:

    rails _4.2.8_ new vanilla

This is for testing of Rails Ruby Bench
(https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench). Specifically, I need
to test Discourse time to process a first successful HTTP request
versus plain Rails with no extra modifications.
